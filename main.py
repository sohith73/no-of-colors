problem statement 
          we will take a image's path as input and give the colors in the image
          how? 
          main
          step 1) Image Library (PIL) to handle image processing
          step 2) count colors lets use list or Counter to do the storing work 
          side 
          step 1) webcolors library to map RGB values to human-readable color names
          format of code 
          - it should be modular.
          - ot should handle errors too.
          bugs 
          1 - man they are many blues dark blue "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26720195/how-to-calculate-a-number-of-shades-and-tints-using-a-rgb-value-in-python"
          didn't help that much but got an idea
          2- 100% problem
          3- some small colors problem 
          optimization
          - we know that resizing , 
          - we can count how many times it occurs(lets leave it for now)
          - we can sort them and display the greatest-
          - and i am ignoring small colors with no conurbation

this function shoud Tries to match an RGB color (which is made up of red, green, and blue values)
to a known color name ,It looks through a list of CSS colors and calculates the "distance"
between each CSS color and the color we provided.
simply Which known color looks closest to the color we have?

half done 
now we need its names of them we can use css for thsi i think if found we will
give ist mane else just normal name

main task starts now we need
Opens an image and tells us what colors are in it, along with their percentages,
but skips any colors that donâ€™t make up enough of the image (like those under 0.1%) big fix.
we will resize for optimization ,
and try sorting too.
